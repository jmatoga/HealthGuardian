HealthGuardian: Smart Health Monitoring

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

-  `Client`: the folder to maintain sources of client

-  `Server`: the folder to maintain sources of server

-  `Scenes`: the folder to maintain scenes dependencies

-  `Resources`: the folder to maintain layout and view of application

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Starting Server
Firstly you have to run a server app.
 
## Starting Client
Client will only work if server is started.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
