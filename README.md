**Java-based**, **multithreaded**, **TCP-based** and **clinet-server** `health application` project to monitor and analyze the user's health condition with a mechanism for assessing the need for a doctor's consultation and the ability to store and share health data history. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
* `java`: the folder to maintain core backend of application
  
   - `Client`: the folder to maintain sources of client

   -  `Server`: the folder to maintain sources of server

   -  `ScenesControllers`: the folder to maintain scenes dependencies

*  `Resources`: the folder to maintain layout and view of application

   - `ScenesLayout`: the folder to maintain layout of scenes in fxml type

   - `Images`: the folder to maintain photos/backgrounds

   - `Styles`: the folder to maintain CSS files

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Starting Server
Firstly you have to run a `Server` class.
 
## Starting Client
Client will only work if server is started.
To start client you have to run `Client` class

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
